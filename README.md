# iScFlow

Handles the 3 main aspects of scRNA-Seq data analysis:
* Incorporates the most widely used tools for handling scRNA-Seq
data and NGS data in general
* Machine learning for self-organisation
* Conceived to run on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters
* Containerisation of the pipeline via the use of Docker,
Singularity* and Shifter
* Also leverages the Nextflow architecture for scalability and
reproducibility
